## Frontier Pilot Simulator 2 – Open Development Playground

Welcome!  
This is a **public repository** for experimenting with **JSBSim** flight dynamics in my free time.  
It is **not a commercial project** (yet) – just a personal playground and a place to share progress with the community.  

If the community shows enough interest and votes for it, this can grow into a full game and possibly a commercial project in the future.
